# HackerNewsSearch

Hacker News Search is an Angular 12 application which performs searches using the Hacker News Algolia API. The user can query the API via an input box and see search results, as well as navigate to the History page to view previous queries. The application stores data in localstorage to allow persistence through refreshes.

## Dependency Installation

Run `npm install` to install all project dependencies. I recommend using the latest version of Node.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
